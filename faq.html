          <h2>Why Vienna? How did you become interested in that city?</h2>
          I have written a dozen books and hundreds of articles for newspapers,
          magazines, and encyclopedias. A full half of my published travel
          books, historical narratives, biographies, thrillers, and mysteries
          deal with or are set in Vienna, Austria. This is more than a quirk on
          my part. I was a student in Vienna in 1968, and went on to live in
          that city, and in other parts of Europe, for roughly the next twenty
          years. I admit to being more than partly in love with Vienna. Having
          grown up in a small coastal town in Oregon, I was charmed and amazed
          by the Austrian capital, my first big city. And this was 1968, when,
          as a dear friend of mine liked to say, Vienna was still in the Moose
          Lodge stage of development. My landlady rationed my baths to once
          weekly; there were roughly torn squares of the daily Kurier newspaper
          dangling on a string from a bent nail in the clo to be used as toilet
          paper; beer, of a delicious species I had never known existed, was
          fifteen cents the pint; a good schnitzel cost less than a buck; ten
          p.m. was considered late; Bill Haley and His Comets still had pride of
          place in juke boxes. It was love at first sight. Vienna in the Sixties
          and Seventies had the rough-hewn quality of Dublin in the Eighties;
          both have since gone distinctly uptown. I liked them better as the
          down-at-heel dowagers they once were.

          <h2>Have you always wanted to write?</h2>
          My year of college in Vienna provided a revelation of a different
          sort, as well: I discovered that I wanted to write. Weaned of
          television for the first time since I was five, I found that writing
          was not simply a youthful pose, but was instead something I needed to
          do. Vienna served as my Paris for the next decades: it was cheap,
          friendly, accommodating, full of music, and bristling with spies.
          Vienna was situated only miles away from the communist satellite
          countries of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. I had my personal watcher, a
          pale, slim fellow who showed up at the oddest times and places. You
          felt on the edge in Vienna in those years, though it was at heart the
          coziest of bourgeois cities. Vienna was, and will always be, my second
          home; my daughter was born there, and I came to a facsimile of
          adulthood there. I soon found a theme that I have explored for several
          decades: the amazing renaissance of Vienna 1900. That culture and
          epoch created the modern sensibility through the works of such seminal
          artists, writers, and thinkers as Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon
          Schiele, Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, Arthur Schnitzler, Sigmund Freud,
          Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among many
          others. Vienna 1900 was also the breeding ground for such future
          tyrants as Trotsky, Stalin, and Hitler, all of whom also spent time in
          the city. My Hitler in Vienna, 1907-1913: Clues to the Future began
          this exploration, juxtaposing the largely Jewish-led ferment in
          culture against the early down-and-out years of Hitler. I went on to
          write guides, Vienna Inside Out and Viennawalks, as well as the World
          War II thriller, Time of the Wolf, all of them inspired by my
          researches and years of living in Vienna.

          <h2>How did you get the idea for the Viennese Mystery series?</h2>
          In the mid 1990s I first toyed with creating a historical mystery
          series set in Vienna 1900. Early attempts had Mark Twain and then
          Thomas Edison as the protagonists. Finally, however, I hit on using a
          character from those abortive novels, Hanns Gross, the real-life
          “father of criminology,” as one of the major characters in a new
          attempt at a series. Methods of modern crime detection, including
          crime-scene preservation, the gathering and examination of footprints
          and fingerprints, the study of blood traces and weapons, handwriting
          analysis, and the vetting and interviewing of witnesses and suspects,
          were established by Gross in his decades as an investigative
          magistrate (at once an investigating officer and circuit court judge).
          Later, as the first professor of criminology in the Habsburg realms,
          Gross codified his principles in hundreds of articles and in the
          classic texts Criminal Investigation and Criminal Psychology. In many
          ways, Gross was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock
          Holmes. The series really took off, however, when I struck on my real
          protagonist, a fictional lawyer named Karl Werthen. Werthen, when we
          meet him, is in wills and trusts, having given up criminal law several
          years earlier for reasons we do not at first understand. Meanwhile, he
          fills out the missing parts of his creative life by penning precious
          short stories that few read. This all changes one morning when a
          client of his, the controversial artist Gustav Klimt, comes to him for
          help: the police suspect him as the perpetrator of a series of grisly
          murders in Vienna during the summer of 1898. Werthen soon calls in his
          old colleague, Gross, to aid in this case.
          <hr class="hr-divider" />
          <h2>Tell us a bit about the books in the series:</h2>
          Our duo makes its debut in The Empty Mirror, a novel which features,
          among other luminaries of Vienna 1900 such as Klimt, the sexologist
          Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing, the Habsburg heir apparent,
          Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl.
          Werthen and Gross return for a second installment, Requiem in Vienna,
          in which the composer Gustav Mahler is at the center of the action.
          Each book in the series features one or more actual historical figures
          from the time in an exploration of a society on the edge of the
          momentous changes, an imperial culture locked on a path toward the
          convulsions of World War I. I feel as if I have finally come to my
          true writing home with these Viennese mysteries. They allow me a happy
          blend of research and fiction. As the series progresses, I have become
          more familiar with Werthen, his family, and friends. It is an
          association I hope to cultivate for many years.
