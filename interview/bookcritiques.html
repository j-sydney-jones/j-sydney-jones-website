              <p class="card-text">I am a bit of a hybrid as a writer. I started out in nonfiction though fiction has always been my first love. The game plan at the time was to gain publishing credits through travel writing (I was living in Vienna and other places in Europe), and then build on those to narrative history (including a survey of Vienna 1900), and from there I would move to fiction. Well, duhh. Not being a graduate of a writing program, I really had no idea how the publishing industry works and how easy it is to get pigeonholed.</p>
