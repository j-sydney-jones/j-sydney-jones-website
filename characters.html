                            <h5>Gustav Klimt</h5>
                            One of the founding members of the Vienna Secession, or Vienna's art nouveau pioneers, Gustav Klimt was very much in the public eye by 1898 when we first encounter him. He was already famous, or infamous, for his highly erotic paintings. Even his more staid society portraits were filled with an almost palpable erotic charge. Upon his death in 1918 it was discovered why: it seemed Klimt began his portraits as a nude, then layer by layer of paint he "dressed" these society women. Klimt makes appearances in several of the Viennese Mystery books.

                            Klimt and his great friend and mistress, Emilie Flöge, the designer, enjoyed shocking the staid Viennese with their reform dress: loose-fitting smocks for both men and women.

                            Gustav Mahler was one of the youngest directors Vienna's Court Opera ever had. Just thirty-seven when he took over that position in 1897, he soon transformed the opera, ridding it of useless tradition and insisting upon punctual arrival by the audience. His high-handedness earned him numerous enemies, one of whom seems intent on killing the composer in the second installment of the series, Requiem in Vienna.
