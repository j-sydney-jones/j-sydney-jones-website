            Critically acclaimed novelist J. Sydney Jones brings Cold War Europe
            to stark and often humorous life in this memoir of his two decades
            living in Vienna as a foreign correspondent and fledgling writer.
            With the same attention to detail exhibited in his acclaimed
            "Viennese Mysteries" series, Jones parses the world of Central
            Europe, from the quotidian to the political. Here is the blue-eyed
            refugee from the Biafran War, Ubhani, the man in the tower of the
            title, seeking asylum in the Austrian capital; the Hungarian patriot
            who pays his own special tribute to the 1956 uprising; the
            nondescript state police agent commissioned to watch foreigners in
            neutral Austria to ensure they did not ruffle the feathers of the
            Soviets; the editor of a prestigious Viennese publishing house none
            too eager to do business with a brash young Ami. Travel with Jones
            back to Czechoslovakia just months after the Soviet's brutal
            suppression of Prague Spring in'68; to guard towers along the
            waist-deep waters of a lake on the Austro-Hungarian border; to a
            cozy armchair at the British Council Library; to an all-purpose
            Tabak Trafik: to life in a Cretan cave; or to the final voyage of
            the SS France. Jones proves a dependable and insightful guide to
            this forgotten world before the Wall came down. An added bonus is
            the short story, "Body Blows," which introduces Sam Kramer, the
            foreign correspondent protagonist from Jones's new series of novels
            set in Europe following the fall of the Wall.
