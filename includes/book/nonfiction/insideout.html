                    In this book will be found not only the monuments and palaces that go to make up most travel books, but also those bits and pieces of everyday human life found in between the usual tourist sights that go to make up the real story of a city. In it will be those sights, sounds and smells that give as accurate a picture of Vienna as any painter could.
                    
                    Vienna is one of the last truly European cities: her storefronts are architectural gems, her streets winding museums, and her history a showcase of intellectual and artistic glory. Viennawalks explores the treasures of this magnificent city, which can truly be appreciated only on foot.</p>
