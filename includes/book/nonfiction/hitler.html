          <!--body-->
          <p class="card-text">
            In 1907 a young man, with a suitcase full of sketches and artistic
            dreams, came from a small provincial town to Vienna. Six years later
            this same young man, hardened by an alchemy of failure and
            disappointment, his dreams turned to nightmares, left that city, set
            on a path of hatred and revenge. Here is what happened in those six
            years to bring about such a total change in the life of that young
            man, and consequently in the history of the world. Hitler in Vienna
            is a fascinating portrait of a city that was spawning Hitler and, at
            the same time, the genius of Freud, Mahler, Schoenberg, Wittgenstein
            and many others. Many of the bright stars of this cultural
            renaissance were Jewish. And this book shows how closely the two
            sides of genius and malignancy were knit when it pictures a waning
            imperial society producing the seminal intellectual revolution of
            the century and at the same time as it was planting the seeds of the
            Holocaust.
