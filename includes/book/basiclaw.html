            Expat American journalist Sam Kramer is burned out: too many dead
            bodies, too many wars covered, too little meaning in it all. He’s
            got a dead-end job at the Daily European as the correspondent for
            Vienna, where nothing happens now that the Cold War is over. And
            that is exactly how Kramer likes it. But his private neutral zone is
            shattered with news of the suicide of Reni Müller, a German
            left-wing firebrand and Kramer’s long-estranged ex-girlfriend. To
            his surprise, Kramer suddenly finds himself the executor of Reni’s
            literary estate—but the damning memoir named in her will is nowhere
            to be found. Tracking down the manuscript will lead Kramer to the
            unsettling truth of Reni’s death, drawing him back into the days of
            the Cold War and showing him the dark side of the woman he loved.
