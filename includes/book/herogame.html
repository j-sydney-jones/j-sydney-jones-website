            Jack Kavanagh was an Irish hero, jailed for fighting against fascism
            in Spain, when the Nazis offered him the choice of working for them
            or rotting in prison. His reluctant mission is to foment an uprising
            in Ireland that distracts the English and lays them open to Nazi
            invasion. But all too quickly and cruelly he learns he is but a dupe
            in a deadly doublecross--a pawn in a bloody assassination plot.
            Trapped in this sinister scheme engineered by the Third Reich's most
            feared secret agent, desperate about the fate of World War II and
            his own life, Kavanagh turns to beautiful Bridget O'Toole, the only
            one knowledgeable and daring enough to help him. As the two of them
            race to beat the agonizing odds, the clock of terror ticks away and
            the countdown begins on one of the most savage and cowardly acts of
            violence meant to change the course of history....
