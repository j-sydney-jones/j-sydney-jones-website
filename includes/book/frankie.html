                    Together, Frankie and Luke jump a train to the huge tent city in Ludlow, Colorado, where the strikers have been living since the shutdown of the coal mines. Tension between the miners and the mine guards is mounting, and the National Guard has been called in to maintain order. Caught up in the strike, the teenagers witness the militia violently attack a women's march to protest the imprisonment of Mother Jones, the eighty-two-year-old union organizer. As the conflict worsens, Frankie takes matters in her own hands. A shocking revelation makes Luke finally realize that Frankie will always be a stranger and he cannot stop her from carrying out a dangerous plan.
                    
                    This exciting story of adventure, mystery, and romance is set against the turbulent background of a true but little-known Colorado coal miners' strike in 1913-1914.</p>
