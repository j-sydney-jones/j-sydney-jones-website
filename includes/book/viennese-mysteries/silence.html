            Vienna, 1900. Lawyer and private inquiries agent Karl Werthen is
            puzzling over the high-profile suicide of a city councilman--former
            client, next in line to Vienna’s powerful Mayor Karl Lueger, and the
            last man Werthen would think capable of suicide. Werthen, however,
            has little time to ponder, as he is summoned by wealthy
            industrialist Karl Wittgenstein (father of the future philosopher
            Ludwig) to find his oldest son, Hans, who has gone missing. Werthen
            soon discovers the whereabouts of the musically-minded Hans, and the
            case appears to be solved. But appearances are deceiving, and a
            simple missing person’s case soon leads back to the councilman's
            suicide. Werthen—once again ably assisted by his wife, Berthe, and
            real-life father of criminology, Dr. Hanns Gross—journeys into a
            sinister web of deceit and violence that threatens not only his
            life, but also the very heart of the city and the empire.
