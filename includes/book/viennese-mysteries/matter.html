            October, 1901. Lawyer and private enquiries agent Karl Werthen
            accepts an assignment to protect the famous Irish writer Bram Stoker
            while on a speaking tour of Vienna. Meanwhile, his colleague,
            renowned criminologist Dr Hanns Gross has been called away to advise
            on a bizarre series of murders near his hometown of Graz, in the
            Austrian province of Styria. Three women have been killed with
            strange mutilations and scarring patterns left on their bodies. The
            third, most recent victim has had her unborn baby cut out of her
            womb. Clues have been left at each scene; clues that have been
            clearly mentioned in Gross’s handbook for magistrates, Criminal
            Investigation. A coincidence? Dr Gross thinks not. Meanwhile, back
            in Vienna, Werthen’s wife Berthe is investigating what seems to be a
            fraudulent breeding scheme involving the prized Lipizzaner horses.
            Could the two investigations possibly be connected? Matters become
            complicated with Werthen and Stoker’s arrival in Graz. For, having
            read wild newspaper accounts of vampire killings, the Dracula author
            insists they investigate.
