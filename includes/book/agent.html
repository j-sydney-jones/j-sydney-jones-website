          <!--body-->
          <p class="card-text">
            February, 1917. A lone German agent is despatched to Washington to
            prevent the British delivering a telegram to President Wilson – by
            any means possible. For this is the Zimmermann telegram: it contains
            a devastating piece of news which is sure to bring the USA into the
            war on the side of Britain and her allies. Having fought in the
            trenches himself, Max Volkman knows that America’s involvement will
            only prolong the slaughter of innocents and is implacable in his
            determination to kill the British envoy carrying the telegram. But
            when his pursuit of the Englishman leads him to the home of American
            heiress Catherine Fitzgerald, wife to one of Washington’s most
            powerful politicians, he is presented with a terrible choice:
            loyalty to his comrades in the trenches or the loss of the one woman
            he has ever truly loved. His decision will determine the outcome of
            the First World War.
