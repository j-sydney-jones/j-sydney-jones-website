            Nuremberg is a dead city. In the aftermath of World War II,
            two-thirds of its population has fled or is deceased, with thirty
            thousand bodies turning the ruined industrial center into a massive
            open grave. Here, the vilest war criminals in history will be tried.
            But in Nuremberg’s dark streets and back alleys, chaos rules.
            Captain Nathan Morgan is one of those charged with bringing order to
            the home of the war crime trials. A New York homicide detective who
            spent the war in Army intelligence, he was born to be a spy—and now,
            in 1945, there is no finer place for his trade than Nuremberg. As
            the US grapples with the Soviets for postwar supremacy, a serial
            murderer targets the occupying forces. Nathan Morgan may be the
            perfect spy, but it’s time for him to turn cop once more.
