                                <p>The author of travel guides, biographies, and thrillers and mysteries for adults, J. Sydney Jones pursues a central theme in all of his work: illumination of the past in order to cast light on the present. In his thrillers as well as his works of nonfiction, the emphasis is on historical insight.</p>
                                <p>Born on a farm in northeastern South Dakota, Jones is one of four siblings. With the death of his father when Jones was five, the family moved to Oregon, where Jones grew up a small coastal town. He attended university in Oregon, and then studied abroad, an experience that changed his life and made him want to become a writer.</p>
                                <p>After graduating from college, Jones returned to Europe, living in Vienna, Paris, Florence, Greece, and Ireland on and off for the next fifteen years. During that time, he made a living as a freelance writer and language teacher, also picking up odd jobs along the way, including work as a messenger for the United Nations and as a produce man in a supermarket. </p>
                                <p>During those years Jones also wrote several books, including the travel guides Bike and Hike, Vienna Inside-Out, Viennawalks, and Tramping in Europe, as well as the heavily researched Hitler in Vienna, 1907-1913, a history of the six years young Hitler spent in that city. Published initially in German translation, that biography won critical praise on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
                                <p>In 1985 Jones returned to the United States, taking up residence along the central coast of California, where he continues to freelance and teach both English as a second language and writing at a local college. Further publications included the standalone WWII thrillers, The Time of the Wolf and The Hero Game, as well as a standalone young adult historical novel, Frankie.</p>
                                <p>In 2009 Jones published The Empty Mirror, the first novel in his "Viennese Mystery" series. Set in fin de si√®cle Vienna, the novels feature former criminal attorney Karl Werthen his longtime friend Dr. Hanns Gross, the real-life father of criminology. Jones followed up that series debut with five more novels in the same series: Requiem in Vienna, The Silence, The Keeper of Hands, A Matter of Breeding, and The Third Place.</p>
                                <p>Jones has also published a number of stand-alone thrillers, including Ruin Value, The German Agent, Basic Law, and The Edit. He is currently at work on a mystery series set during World War II on the California coast, as well as a contemporary espionage novel involving ghosts from the Cold War. </p>
                                <p>When not writing books or freelancing, Jones enjoys tennis and walking on the beach. Married, Jones is the father of two.</p>
