              <p class="card-text">If the idea of a standard prepackaged tour of Europe makes you squirm, this book urges you to get up and do it your way--walk! Going on foot is something almost anyone can do, and with the various and manageable tours charted here, you can learn to experience the landscapes, culture, and people of the continent and Great Britain on their own unique terms.

                    Whether you want to stroll off to the Ile de France--just an afternoon away from Paris--or trek by the light of the midnight sun and cramp on a remote Norwegian mountainside, this down-to-earth guide to traveling through twenty-five countries is your one source for doing it right. Tramping in Europe gives you eighteen in-depth tours through eleven countries.
                    
                    You'll also find detailed maps, equipment checklists, metric conversions, and additional advice on where to hike in fourteen other countries from Belgium to the former Yugoslavia. 3500 kilometers of the loveliest trails in the world!</p>
